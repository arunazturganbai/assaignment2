This code defines a class called MyArrayList that implements the MyList interface. MyArrayList is a generic class, meaning that it can store elements of any type.

The class has three instance variables:
- data: an array of objects that stores the elements of the list
- size: an integer that keeps track of the number of elements in the list

The constructor initializes data to an array of size 10 and sets size to 0.
